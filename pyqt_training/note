I'm reading the book pyqt5, so I need a project to build when finishing it for practice
I choose to build a HACKER SYSTEM
Us hackers tend to be messy all the time with what are we learning building and researching
so it's harder to make notes where we left off and where do we want to go and basicly having
an agenda, first we have to understand that even tough this is a good idea, we don't like to
be rountine-like because we don't feel free so, I'm gonna let it stay that way as for time 
and scheduling tasks, but of course respecting and knowing the value of time should make
me get around somethings here
